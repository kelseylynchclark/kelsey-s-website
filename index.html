<p> Hello world,how are you all?</p>
<p> My name is kelsey. i am a very busy person as i have to juggle work life, college life and a social life, which is proving to be very difficult with all the assignments i have.</p>
<p> Im not very interesting, i spend a lot time at home with family, only really going out on special occassions such as birthdays and family gatherings.</p>
<p> When i am older i want to be a forensic scientist.I am just not sure what field i would like to work in yet, i am very undecisive, I am hoping to attend the University Of Manchester when i am finished with college</p>
